### Code example
**KATA description from [CODEWARS](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5266876b8f4bf2da9b000362):**
> *You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item. Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item.*


**Solution:**
```
function likes(names) {
    // array.lenght=0 
    if (names.length == 0) {
        return (`no one likes this`);
    }
    // 1 likes
    if (names.length == 1) {
        return (`${names[0]} likes this`);
    }
    // 2 likes
    if (names.length == 2) {
        return (`${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`);
    }
    // 3 likes
    if (names.length == 3) {
        return (`${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`);
    }
    // 4 and more likes
    if (names.length >= 4) {
        return (`${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names.length-2} others like this`);
    }
}
```
